Apollo
===================

The Apollo is a remote controlled Rover
which can be controlled over large distances with almost no delay.

How does it work?
-------------
The Raspberry on the Rover(Rover base) connects via. Java TCP Sockets, to an external Server(Rover Satellite).
When Rover is successfully connected, the Rover can now be controlled
by using Rover Station software.
